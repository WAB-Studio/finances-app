/**
 * Every non-archived goal with its progress in ONE round trip (RF-87, RNF-09):
 * `saved_cents` sums the goal's own aportes, and only the ones set aside in the
 * goal's currency, so no meta is measured against two currencies added together
 * (RF-124) — which is what the `goal_progress` view, blind to the currency,
 * cannot do. An aporte earmarking a movement is in that movement's currency; a
 * virtual one is in the goal's, and so is one whose movement the caller cannot
 * read, which joins as null rather than dropping out of the sum. Remaining
 * floors at zero so an overshot goal reads as reached, not negative. `archived` swaps the
 * listing onto the archived side (RF-120); the view knows nothing of the flag,
 * so an archived goal's progress keeps deriving from its aportes. Scope is the
 * policy's job: `withUserDb` shows only the caller's readable goals.
 *
 * The pace rides along from the same read, in exact numeric arithmetic and back
 * as integer cents: the monthly figure spreads what remains over the whole months
 * still ahead — at least one, so a goal due this month asks for all of it — and a
 * goal counts as behind when what it has set aside sits under the straight line
 * from the day it opened to the day it is due. Neither is stored (RNF-07).
 *
 * The rows come back in the reading order of the artboard — atrasada, al día,
 * cumplida, sin fecha, and by name inside each band — so the desktop table and
 * the phone cards list the same goals in the same order.
