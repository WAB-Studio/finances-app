/**
 * Every liability that carries debt terms with its derived figures in ONE round
 * trip (RF-78, RF-79, RNF-09): owed is the magnitude of the balance derived by
 * `account_balances` FOR THE POCKET THE CARD BILLS IN; the limit rides along for
 * the consolidated sums and available credit nets it against that same pocket
 * (both null with no limit); the monthly interest is the effective twelfth-root
 * step of the annual rate, NOT the linear `rate/12`, and that step rides along as
 * a rate of its own so the screen states the percentage without dividing
 * anything; the minimum is the fixed amount, or a percentage
 * of the owed, or null; and due installments sum the unpaid lines falling on or
 * before the next due date. No figure is re-summed from a stored balance, and the
 * CALLER folds these rows into the totals — this adds no round trip for them.
 *
 * The view answers one row per account AND currency since `0032`, so every
 * figure above names the settlement currency in its join: unbounded, the join
 * would return the debt once per currency it holds and each of those readings
 * would net a peso limit against a dollar balance. What the card holds in
 * another currency rides along as `otherOwed`, which nothing here adds up
 * (RF-121, RF-124).
