 * narrowed to the movements touching its account and/or carrying its label, and
 * only the movements booked in the budget's own currency, so no limit is ever
 * measured against two currencies added together (RF-124); a
 * correlated subselect picks each row's window by its period. The window bounds
 * come from `periodRange` around `anchorDate` (today by default), so a stored
 * spent column never exists; the anchor only slides the window the split sum
 * derives over, never a budget's period or threshold (RF-72).
 * `archived` swaps the listing onto the archived side (RF-120): the two sides
 * partition the readable budgets, and an archived one derives its figures the
 * same way, since nothing about the spend is special-cased or stored.
 * Scope is the policy's job: `withUserDb` shows only the caller's readable rows.
