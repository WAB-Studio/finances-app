/**
 * Reads a headword's real-use frequency per part of speech from SUBTLEX-US
 * with part-of-speech information, and writes the derived order into
 * `lib/dictionary/pos-frequency.ts` (RL-43). `groupFor` reads that file to
 * order a headword's senses by how often each is really used, instead of
 * `index-build.ts`'s fixed `POS_RANK`, which cannot put both "grudge"'s
 * noun first and "leave"'s verb first — no single rank gives both.
 *
 * Source: SUBTLEX-US frequency list with PoS and Zipf information, at
 * `private/subtlex-pos.xlsx` — not committed, and never downloaded by this
 * script. Get it from https://www.ugent.be/pp/experimentele-psychologie/en/
 * research/documents/subtlexus and place it there before running this.
 * Licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/),
 * so the table this script writes carries the same licence — non-commercial,
 * share-alike — and the credit belongs on `/cuenta` beside the dictionary's
 * own (`components/account/account-info.tsx`).
 *
 * The workbook is a zip of XML parts; `unzip` (already relied on by
 * `build-dictionary.ts` for its own archive) extracts the two that matter —
 * `xl/sharedStrings.xml`, the string pool every text cell indexes into, and
 * `xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml`, the 74,287-row sheet itself — and
 * `fast-xml-parser` reads both, the same dependency `build-dictionary.ts`
 * already carries for the TEI source.
 *
 * Column A is the word, M is `All_PoS_SUBTLEX` and N is `All_freqs_SUBTLEX`:
 * two dot-separated lists in the same order, e.g. `Article.Adverb.Noun` and
 * `993445.33186.257`. Of SUBTLEX's raw labels, only five have a `PartOfSpeech`
 * this app's dictionary uses — Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Name — and a
 * word carrying the same one twice sums the two frequencies rather than
 * keeping the last. `phraseologicalUnit` has no SUBTLEX equivalent and never
 * gets a frequency, so a headword whose senses are only that keeps its
 * `POS_RANK` order regardless of what this table says.
 *
 * A word is worth a row only where it changes anything: the dictionary
 * headword must itself carry two or more distinct parts of speech (only
 * there does an order exist to get right), and SUBTLEX must score two or
 * more of exactly those parts of speech (a single scored one leaves nothing
 * to compare). Every other headword — one part of speech, or fewer than two
 * SUBTLEX scores among the ones it has — is left for `POS_RANK` to order,
 * unrecorded here.
 *
 * The order itself is what ships, not the frequencies behind it: `groupFor`
 * only ever needs which sense comes first, so each row is a string of
 * single-letter codes (n, v, j for adjective, d for adverb, p for the proper
 * -noun "Name" bucket) in descending-frequency order — "leave" writes "vn",
 * "grudge" writes "nv" — rather than the numbers themselves.
 *
 * Run: `npm run pos:build -w apps/voyager`, with the source in place. Rerun
 * it whenever `public/dictionary/`'s payload is rebuilt, since the set of
 * multi-part-of-speech headwords it intersects against comes from there.
