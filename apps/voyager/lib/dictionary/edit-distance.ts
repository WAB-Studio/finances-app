// once and still surface all of them here; RL-29 is what tells that reader
// none of them is what they meant, not this function withholding the list.

// Ranking: `POS_FREQUENCY_ORDER` carries no number, only a per-headword
// part-of-speech order, so it cannot say a rowed candidate is used more
// than another rowed one — inventing a score on top of it was refused
// (`docs/voyager/DESIGN.md`, RL-28, 2026-09-11). What it can say is which
// candidates it has ever measured at all: those sort ahead as one block,
// alphabetical among themselves; the rest keep today's alphabetical order
// behind them. `fettle`'s four candidates carry no row, so it is unchanged.
