/**
 * The four claims the Metas screen makes about money it never stores (RF-87,
 * RF-119, RNF-07): every bar says whose goal it is and how far it stands, a goal
 * that has fallen under the straight line to its target date reads as atrasada,
 * the table's total states what the rows on screen add up to, and undoing one
 * aporte takes that aporte and nothing else. The last is a silent-money-loss path
 * — a removal that reaches the wrong row lowers a figure nobody is watching — so
 * the cents are read back from Postgres and not only from the screen that wrote
 * them.
 *
 * That straight line runs from the day a goal opened, so one goal here is opened
 * months back: `savings_goals_set_timestamps` keeps a `created_at` the INSERT
 * names and still stamps `now()` for one that names none (migration 0029). The
 * seam is open to the owner connection these fixtures run over and shut to an
 * `authenticated` caller, whose INSERT grant names no `created_at`. No test here
 * disables a trigger.
