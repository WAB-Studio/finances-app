/**
 * RF-59 and RF-11 on the roster, driven the way a person reaches them. Both were
 * proved once in a throwaway script; this is what will catch them tomorrow.
 *
 * The transfer is a swap nothing on screen can show in one place: the badge moves
 * to the other person and the caller's own row loses everything but the rename,
 * while the two `role` columns change in the same statement. Both halves are
 * asserted, and the columns are read from Postgres rather than inferred from the
 * screen that ordered the change.
 *
 * The delete refusal is the other direction: RF-11 says a member whose person left
 * an economic trace is archived, never deleted, and the only proof that holds is
 * a confirmed delete that answers in words and leaves the row where it was.
