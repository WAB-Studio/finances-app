/**
 * One pass over the seven settings screens, none of which any check had opened.
 * The HTTP layer already proves each route answers 200; what it cannot prove is
 * that the data reached the screen — the whole next-intl catalogue ships in the
 * page payload, so a title matches even when nothing rendered. Every assertion
 * here is therefore a seeded value or an interpolated message carrying one.
 *
 * The RF-100 describes prove that requirement on screen, under both roles. The
 * database half is proved by layer 1 (assertions 184-189); nothing until now
 * rendered the roster, and the row menu is only reachable here — Radix mounts a
 * menu's items when it opens and never puts them on the wire.
 *
 * The last describe drives the group's own settings (RF-56, RF-57): its form is
 * the one place where the two columns the leader may write are written at all,
 * and every value it saves is read back from Postgres, never from the screen
 * that wrote it.
