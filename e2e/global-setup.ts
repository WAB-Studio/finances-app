/**
 * Layer 3's ground: the browser's login, the rows the specs read, and the
 * teardown that drops them. Playwright calls the default export once, before any
 * spec, and calls the function it returns once after the last one.
 *
 * The login uses no mailbox and sends nothing. The storage state a spec starts
 * from carries the session cookie `@supabase/ssr` would have written, over an
 * access token the project itself signed — so the proxy, `requireUser()` and
 * every policy see a real `auth.uid()`, and the auth server is never asked to
 * deliver a link to an address that bounces into someone's inbox. Two identities
 * get one state each: the one every spec runs as, and the one RF-100 needs a
 * second role for.
 *
 * Every row here belongs to one of those two users, which nothing else writes,
 * so the purge below is a reset rather than a deletion of someone's data. It runs
 * at both ends: a crashed run leaves the next one a clean queue.
 *
 * The two users are the ones `HARNESS_LANE` selects, and every id below comes
 * from them, so a run on one lane never names a row another lane owns.
