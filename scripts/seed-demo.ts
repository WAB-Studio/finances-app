/**
 * A full app for a demo user: five accounts, ten months of movements, and one
 * row of every planning entity, so no screen is judged empty. Everything is
 * written THROUGH the app's own query functions — the ledger, the budgets, the
 * goals, the debts and the recurring generator are the ones the app would have
 * written, not SQL invented here.
 *
 * Repeatable: every movement carries an `external_ref` derived from its date and
 * its slot, and every other entity is found again by the name it shows on screen,
 * so a second run tops the fixture up instead of doubling it. `drop` deletes
 * exactly what those names reach, which returns every table to the count it found
 * — `audit_log` excepted, whose rows no path here removes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run seed:demo          # fill the app for the demo user
 *   npm run seed:demo:drop     # take it all back out
 *   npm run seed:demo -- count # census only, writing nothing
 *
 * The user defaults to the person the design is judged by; `--email=` names
 * another.
